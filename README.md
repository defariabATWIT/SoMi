# Dependicies:

Once SoMi is succesfully cloned to your local device select the python intepereter in VSCode and select .venv as the virtual enviroment.

Peform the following package installations in a new terminal while in the project directory:

pip install Flask
pip install werkzeug.utils

# FRONT END:

style.css is in /static. Per Flask requirements it must stay in that folder. I have some basic styling in there while
I was working on it, but it doesn't need to stay that way. It is already linked to index.html

script.js in in /static. Per FLask requirements it must stay in that folder. It is currently linked to index.html but
I haven't yet tested if it's actually linked correctly.
