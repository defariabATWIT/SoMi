FRONT END:

style.css is in /static. Per Flask requirements it must stay in that folder. I have some basic styling in there while

script.js in in /static. Per FLask requirements it must stay in that folder. It is currently linked to index.html but
I haven't yet tested if it's actually linked correctly.
